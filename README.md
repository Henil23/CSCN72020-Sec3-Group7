# Light_Management_System-
LIght Management System which follows the SCADA principle. It is intended to use it in the malls, schools, or anywhere else where they want to manage the lighting of whole building just from one device. 

For to showcase our working prototype we have taken an example of 4 storey building where each floors have 4 rooms, 1 conference room and washrooms. 
First of all, user needs to signup/login in our application to start using the software.
Once logged in they will see a homepage where they can view the calendar, they can write quick notes, and they can see the overall energy used by the lightings. The data for the energy is fetched by sensors from each light fixture. 
Moreover, they can turn on/off the frequently used lights without going to the actual control room. Lights under 'Frequently Used' are selected by the user. 
After that if they want to go to the more detailed operations of light fixtures they can go to next page by clicking on 'Advanced'. On clicking 'Advanced' user can go to main control room where they can turn on/off all the light fixtures of the building. 
Additionally, we have added a 'Customise' button where user can modify the lighting status of the light fixture and also they have the liberty to set the schedule for how long they have to keep the lights on. 
Talking about the user accessbility,we have added a Log Out button on every page so that they can log-out and switch users easily. Also, we have added a feature called 'Add Event' where user can add events on specific date and time
